## üîí Privacy & Storage

### What's Stored Locally

- Gemini API key (in browser localStorage)
- User profiles (names, emails, login method)
- Saved workflows (full workflow data)
- Workflow execution history (last 100 per profile)
- Feed preference settings (stock/personalized)
- Welcome screen shown status

### Data Safety

- All data stays in your browser's LocalStorage
- No data sent to external servers (except Gemini API calls)
- API key stored locally, never shared
- Clear browser data to reset everything
- Profile deletion removes all associated data

### Storage Limits

- Browser LocalStorage typically allows 5-10MB
- Each workflow is ~1-2KB
- Can store hundreds of workflows per profile
- Execution history limited to last 100 runs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "API request failed"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure API key has Gemini API access enabled
- Try generating a new API key from Google AI Studio

### Workflows won't generate
- Confirm API key is valid
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear LocalStorage and re-login
- Verify Gemini API quota hasn't been exceeded

### Feed not personalizing
- Save at least 3-5 workflows first
- Return to app and choose "personalize my feed" when prompted
- Check hamburger menu ‚Üí current profile has saved workflows
- Try resetting preferences and re-enabling

### App won't load
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try incognito/private mode
- Clear browser cache

### File viewer not working
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check if content type is supported
- Try switching view modes
- Copy content instead if viewer fails

### Progress stuck at 0%
- Refresh the page
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is working
- Look at console for detailed errors

## üé® Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit CSS variables in `css/styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-bg: #141414;        /* Main background */
    --accent-red: #e50914;        /* Primary accent color */
    --text-primary: #ffffff;      /* Text color */
    --glass-bg: rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.8);  /* Glass panels */
}
```

### Adding Custom Workflows

Edit the fallback workflows in `js/workflows.js`:

```javascript
getFallbackWorkflows() {
    return [
        {
            title: "Your Custom Workflow",
            description: "What it does...",
            category: "Automation",
            tools: ["Python", "API"],
            steps: ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
            estimatedTime: "2 minutes",
            difficulty: "easy"
        }
    ];
}
```

### Customizing Workflow Categories

Add your own categories in `js/config.js`:

    'Data Analysis',
    'Your Category',
    'Another Category'
]
```
